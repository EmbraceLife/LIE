# LIE: Learning Is Experimenting

Do you believe this LIE?

Step by step, this repo will testify this LIE by experimenting Kur for deep learning...

## Get started
Other Kur questions are found in [my stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/4333609/daniel?tab=questions)

How to use the cutting edge kur?
1. download kur from github, kur-master.zip
2. open it and go inside kur-master
3. `source activate your-env` and run `pip install -e .`
Now, you have the latest kur to use

## Roadmap
1. Experiment new features on a demo kurfile
2. Convert examples (from simple to advance) to kur
3. Adding new features as they become necessary in examples above


## Accumulation
1. `LIE`: my roadmap (check issues)
2. `deepgram/kur`: learn and contribute to kur (check issues and my own fork)
3. `Morvan tutorials`: learn the most basic examples and convert to kur (issues and my fork)
4. `udacity dlnd repo`: store my project solutions and convert to kur
5. `Hvass tutorials`
5. `fast.ai tutorials`
6. `official keras examples`
7. `official pytorch examples`
8. `shiffman repos`
