# SEE project
kur + p5 + flask = visualizing every step of deep learning examples

## why visualize weights is a must?
- Genuine understanding is a must
- viz helps understanding
	- visualize network layer by layer
	- visualize network over time
	- from dataset to the final output and analysis
- LIE:
 	- experiment is to learn|explore basics
	- visualize is to understand

## Examples to imitate
**Great Examples**
- deepNet [playground](http://playground.tensorflow.org/#activation=sigmoid&batchSize=10&dataset=circle&regDataset=reg-plane&learningRate=0.03&regularizationRate=0&noise=0&networkShape=4,1&seed=0.63749&showTestData=false&discretize=false&percTrainData=50&x=true&y=true&xTimesY=false&xSquared=false&ySquared=false&cosX=false&sinX=false&cosY=false&sinY=false&collectStats=false&problem=regression&initZero=false&hideText=false):
	- Not that cool
	- how to visualize on seemingly pure numbers?
- ConvNet.js [demos](https://github.com/karpathy/convnetjs)
	- coolest so far!!
	- how to visualize on every weights and activations?
	- put them together on a single page has much more power than saving images into different folders!!!!
- maybe shiffman is teaching to combine p5.js and flask.js and keras together
	- [week5](https://github.com/shiffman/NOC-S17-2-Intelligence-Learning/tree/master/week5-cnn-tensorflow): cnn, flask, keras!!!

## Shiffman's repo is the key
