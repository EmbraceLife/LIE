# Kur

**Why so many backend?**
- Keras backend:
	- Theano (first emerged, but now overshadowed by tensorflow)
	- Tensorflow
- pytorch backend:
	- raising star
- keep up with these two backends, so that kur can always ride on the front edge of deep learning libraries
- no worry about one library will become obsolete

**Easy experiment**
- 

**Templates of everything**
- no need to write the same thing ever again
