How to convert dlnd-gan-jupyter to kur?

- write LeakyReLU in keras_kur (done) and pytorch_kur (not yet)
- convert gan models into kur with a dict of models

Clarify the model of dlnd_mnist_gan
- read dlnd_mnist_gan jupyter notebook (now!)
- write the model in kurfile (just keras now, pytorch later)
