1. experiment on `kur`:
	- use of `pdb`, `inspect`
	- read and contribute to source code of library
	- create visualization features for kur
	- [visit my source](https://github.com/EmbraceLife/kur/tree/dive_source_kur)
2. apply my learning in `kur` to Morvan's Pytorch tutorials
	- apply `kur` style of `argparse`
	- save, load, re-train models
	- visualize every step of training
		- it does help understanding
	- [visit my source](https://github.com/EmbraceLife/PyTorch-Tutorial/tree/my_progress)
3. Though completed Udacity-dlnd, I have no confidence in understanding how neural net works for now. The current job is to run all examples and tutorials I can find. Dissect them into useful pieces like the ones below.
4. courses to take:
