### How can I use pre-trained models in Keras?

Code and pre-trained weights are available for the following image classification models:

- Xception
- VGG16
- VGG19
- ResNet50
- Inception v3

They can be imported from the module `keras.applications`:

```python
from keras.applications.xception import Xception
from keras.applications.vgg16 import VGG16
from keras.applications.vgg19 import VGG19
from keras.applications.resnet50 import ResNet50
from keras.applications.inception_v3 import InceptionV3

model = VGG16(weights='imagenet', include_top=True)
```

For a few simple usage examples, see [the documentation for the Applications module](/applications).

For a detailed example of how to use such a pre-trained model for feature extraction or for fine-tuning, see [this blog post](http://blog.keras.io/building-powerful-image-classification-models-using-very-little-data.html).

The VGG16 model is also the basis for several Keras example scripts:

- [Style transfer](https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/examples/neural_style_transfer.py)
- [Feature visualization](https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/examples/conv_filter_visualization.py)
- [Deep dream](https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/examples/deep_dream.py)
