### How is the validation split computed?

If you set the `validation_split` argument in `model.fit` to e.g. 0.1, then the validation data used will be the *last 10%* of the data. If you set it to 0.25, it will be the last 25% of the data, etc. Note that the data isn't shuffled before extracting the validation split, so the validation is literally just the *last* x% of samples in the input you passed.

The same validation set is used for all epochs (within a same call to `fit`).
