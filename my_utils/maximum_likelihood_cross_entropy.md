# maximum_likelihood

## Understanding
1. MLE: maximum_likelihood_estimate is the most likely cause or reason for the observed fact, given there are many causes for explaining the fact

#  cross_entropy or log_loss

## Understanding
1. cross_entropy == log_loss == measure similarity between predictions and true labels|targets, when targets are multiple classes
2. cross_entropy value is small or even down to 0, if predictions are very close to true class targets, or even exact the same to true class targets
3. cross_entropy can be used as loss function to represent the relationship between predictions on classes and true targets on classes
