### Where is the Keras configuration file stored?

The default directory where all Keras data is stored is:

```bash
$HOME/.keras/
```

Note that Windows users should replace `$HOME` with `%USERPROFILE%`.
In case Keras cannot create the above directory (e.g. due to permission issues), `/tmp/.keras/` is used as a backup.

The Keras configuration file is a JSON file stored at `$HOME/.keras/keras.json`. The default configuration file looks like this:

```
{
    "image_data_format": "channels_last",
    "epsilon": 1e-07,
    "floatx": "float32",
    "backend": "tensorflow"
}
```

It contains the following fields:

- The image data format to be used as default by image processing layers and utilities (either `channels_last` or `channels_first`).
- The `epsilon` numerical fuzz factor to be used to prevent division by zero in some operations.
- The default float data type.
- The default backend. See the [backend documentation](/backend).

Likewise, cached dataset files, such as those downloaded with [`get_file()`](/utils/#get_file), are stored by default in `$HOME/.keras/datasets/`.
