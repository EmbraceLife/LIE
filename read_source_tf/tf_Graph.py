class Graph(object):
  """A TensorFlow computation, represented as a dataflow graph.

  A `Graph` contains a set of
  @{tf.Operation} objects,
  which represent units of computation; and
  @{tf.Tensor} objects, which represent
  the units of data that flow between operations.

  A default `Graph` is always registered, and accessible by calling
  @{tf.get_default_graph}.
  To add an operation to the default graph, simply call one of the functions
  that defines a new `Operation`:

  ```python
  c = tf.constant(4.0)
  assert c.graph is tf.get_default_graph()
  ```

  Another typical usage involves the
  @{tf.Graph.as_default}
  context manager, which overrides the current default graph for the
  lifetime of the context:

  ```python
  g = tf.Graph()
  with g.as_default():
    # Define operations and tensors in `g`.
    c = tf.constant(30.0)
    assert c.graph is g
  ```

  Important note: This class *is not* thread-safe for graph construction. All
  operations should be created from a single thread, or external
  synchronization must be provided. Unless otherwise specified, all methods
  are not thread-safe.

  A `Graph` instance supports an arbitrary number of "collections"
  that are identified by name. For convenience when building a large
  graph, collections can store groups of related objects: for
  example, the `tf.Variable` uses a collection (named
  @{tf.GraphKeys.GLOBAL_VARIABLES}) for
  all variables that are created during the construction of a graph. The caller
  may define additional collections by specifying a new name.

    A graph maintains a stack of name scopes. A `with name_scope(...):`

    The `name` argument will be interpreted as follows:

    * A string (not ending with '/') will create a new name scope, in which
      `name` is appended to the prefix of all operations created in the
      context. If `name` has been used before, it will be made unique by

    * A scope previously captured from a `with g.name_scope(...) as

      makes it possible to re-enter existing scopes.
    * A value of `None` or the empty string will reset the current name scope
      to the top-level (empty) name scope.

    For example:

    ```python

              assert e.op.name == "e"
    ```

    The name of the scope itself can be captured by `with
    g.name_scope(...) as scope:`, which stores the name of the scope
    in the variable `scope`. This value can be used to name an
    operation that represents the overall result of executing the ops

      biases = tf.Variable(..., name="biases")

      output = tf.nn.relu(affine, name=scope)
